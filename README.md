**`Bible Southern Sotho`**

Welcome to Sos aka Buka Ya Khale. Sos stands for Southern Sotho, which is a bible that gives default bible translation in Southern Sotho. This means native Sesotho speaking people have the bible by default. They do not need to download it. This idea started around 2013/2014 as a personal project. The project has undergone four evolution phases.

* First version was just a normal android app reading text files
* Second version was Cordova reading sqlite database
* Third version was android again reading sqlite
* Fourth version now is Flutter.

## Inspiration
As a software engineer and a follower of Jesus, I was compelled to create this app to help dissemintate the gospel. 
* Someone needs Jesus.
* Someone needs some love.
