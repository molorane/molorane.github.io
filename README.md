**`Southern Sotho Bible`**

I am Mothusi a Software Engineer and welcome to SSO aka Buka Ya Khale. SSO stands for Southern Sotho, which is a bible in Southern Sotho. This is an app that I created to enable Sesotho speaking people to have the bible 
in their vernecular on their phones. This idea started around 2013/2014 as a personal project. The project has undergone four evolution phases.
First version was just a normal android app reading text files
Second version was Cordova reading sqlite database
Third version was android again reading sqlite
Fourth version now is Flutter.

## Inspiration
As a software engineer and a follower of Jesus, I was compelled to create this app to help dissemintate the gospel. 
Someone needs Jesus.
Someone needs some love.
